# Milestone Project #3
This application is a challenge day from 100 days of SwiftUI. It's not a tutorial app, but the requirements were given from the series. The application is a kids Times table application, allowing the user to select difficulty of which times table to use, randomly select it optionally, and how many questions to be asked. 

## Rules/Requirements given by 100 Days of SwiftUI 

So, very roughly:

    1.) The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 2 to 12.
    2.) The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, or 20.
    3.) You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.
